# blockchain-voting-system
Block chain voting system with NodeJS 

AIM:
The block chain might offer a massively scalable solution to current and outdated voting methods by providing secure and fraud-proof digital voting.

DESCRYPTION:
The Block chain is The Block chain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block typically contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp and transaction data. By using this advanced technology, we will be able to gain transparency into our elections, without compromising voter privacy, and have a way to mathematically prove that the elections results are accurate. In addition, at the voterâ€™s request, there would even be a way to allow a voter to cast their vote online in an election and follow their vote into the ballot box to ensure that their vote was safely and securely stored without being changed or altered in any way.
